# Apartment Logger

Welcome to the Apartment Logger ReadMe! This project was inspired by my frustrations of moving to San Francisco. The purpose of this project is to showcase the use of Jquery to alter the DOM using data pulled from an API. In this case, I fetch and parse data from the Google Maps API and traverse the data for data depending in the input of a given address or location name. With this data and my apartment object that was created from HTML form input, the app dynamically adds a marker on the Google Map and creates a new list item containing the apartment info.

If this were a real app, I envision it being used by a pair or group of room/housemates to coordinate an apartment/house hunt or simply by a single person that would like to stay organized.
